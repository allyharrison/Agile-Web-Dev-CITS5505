## Assessment Criteria

### Front End

The first part of the project assessment will evaluate the front-end functionality of the application:

1. The application must be functional so that the user can easily use the application as intended.
2. The application must be implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript (or a subset thereof).
3. All resources used (including pictures, JavaScript libraries, css) must be fully referenced.
4. The HTML and CSS must pass the validators: https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ .
5. The website must work on Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, and render well on mobile devices.
6. There must be a consistent style (via CSS file) for all pages, yet each page should be easily identifiable.

### Back-end (40%)

The second part of the project assessment evaluates the back-end functionality of the application. At least the following functionality should be provided:

1. A user account and tracking feature.
2. A method to store interactions and results.
3. A method to search previous interactions.

### Agile processes (25%)

The third part of the project assessment will evaluate the Agile process used to create the application. Your Github repo will be used to provide evidence of this, in particular there should be:

1. Regular commits with meaningful messages.
2. Use of issues to discuss bugs, and plan new features.
3. Use of pull requests, with code reviews provided by your group.
4. Intermediate deliverables, pinpointed with Git tags.

## Local Development

To run the project locally, first set up a `venv`, then `pip install` `requirements-dev` and then run flask.

```sh
# Activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv tmp-env
source tmp-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # (this includes requirements.txt)

# Apply migrations
flask db upgrade 8f09b1c4c9ea

# Start app
flask run
```

If you would like to run with "livereload", run `python local_dev.py` instead of calling `flask run`.
This works well if you are editing HTML/CSS, not so great for editing Python files.

```sh
python local_dev.py
```

# Deploying

When deploying to production, only install `requirements.txt` (don't install `requirements-dev.txt`)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
